# BINGO
<br>
<pre style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;">
    This is one of my most advanced <big><b>console based</b></big> game.

    It is advanced because, it can do random entry itself.

    As you can see it asks whether to use random value or do it 
    manually like.

    The final result of manual entry will be same as the random 
    one but with manual entry 🙂👍.
